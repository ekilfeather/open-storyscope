Readers were asked to provide a solution to this insoluble puzzle!

I sought the inner principle and not the outward appearance.”<br >This idea of seeking the inner principle and not the outward appearance is reminiscent of a quote about modern art by the 19th century French Symbolist poet, Paul Valery.

She studied together with her friend, Evie Hone- another important Irish artist who went on to develop a successful career in stained glass. <br >The painting is resolutely flat, there is no illusion that the frame of the picture is a window into a 3-D space; the viewers’ eyes does not have the opportunity to journey into a receding background.

snapshot11,user2,set11,"Even though 'Decoration' is an abstract painting, it does strongly recall a religious icon painting in terms of the shape of the panel – like a church window- the use of gold paint, and her choice of medium. <br >Mainie chose to paint 'Decoration' using tempera on wood panel. Tempera is a mixture of pigment and egg yolk which was the primary medium used in panel painting in medieval and early renaissance Europe until the 1500s. It was a very suitable medium for those stylised and flat medieval panel paintings, as when it dries it produces a smooth, matte, opaque finish. <br >However, tempera paintings rarely have the deep colour saturation of oil paintings and so the colours in 'Decoration' do not pop or attract attention; they are quite muted, faded, and matte looking.<br >In the 30s and 40s, Mainie’s paintings would become more overtly religious, with stylised and semi-abstracted representations of the crucifixion, pieta, and Madonna and child.
