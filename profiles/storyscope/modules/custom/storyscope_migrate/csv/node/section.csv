section109,user2,Early life of Denis Mahon,"Sir Denis Mahon (1910-2011), one of the most famous art collectors and art historians of the twentieth century, was born in 1910, in No.33 Cadogan Square, London, to John FitzGerald Mahon and Lady Alice Evelyn Browne.",event225,,EOL
section110,user2,Denis Mahon’s developing interest in 17th century Italian Artists,"At an early age, he developed an interest in history, which he went on to study at Oxford. While there, Kenneth Clark (1903-1983), then a curator at the Ashmolean Museum, recommended that he study art history with the art and architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner (1902-1983), who had moved to England in 1933 to escape Hitler’s regime. Pevsner, then teaching at the Courtauld, suggested that Mahon focus his research on the Italian artists of the seventeenth century.",event40|event220|event52|event221|event192|event210,,EOL

section112,user2,Nikolaus Pevsner motivates Mahon to focus on 17th century Italian artists,"Pevsner, then teaching at the Courtauld, suggested that Mahon focus his research on the Italian artists of the seventeenth century. These artists, as Kenneth Clark notes in this letter (below) to Mahon, had fallen out of favour with art historians and were neglected by researchers, but would become popular in the future.",event220|event221|event192,,EOL
section113,user2,Mahon’s developing interest in Guercino and the revival of Italian Baroque artists,"The Bolognese artist, Giovanni Francesco Barbieri (1591-1666), became a particular interest of Mahon’s. Barbieri, nicknamed ‘Guercino’ (meaning ‘The Squinter’, because he was cross-eyed) is now recognised as one of the greatest Italian Baroque artists, but when Denis Mahon acquired his first artwork by Guercino in 1934 – Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph (1620) – it cost him a mere £120.",event209|event194|event121|event193,,EOL
section114,user2,Guercino’s changing artistic style,"Guercino is an interesting character for a number of reasons. Firstly, his painting style changed dramatically over the course of his long career. Before the 1620s, his style was dark and dramatic- his use of ‘chiaroscuro’ (extremes of deep shadows and bright highlights), bold naturalism, and innovative compositions led many to call him one of the Caravaggisti, or a follower of the artist, Caravaggio (1571-1610).",event193|event55,,EOL
section115,user2,Guercino’s trip to Rome in the early 1600’s led to a change in artistic style,"Following a trip to Rome in the early 1600s, however, Guercino began to paint in a very different manner, in a more austere, classical style similar to that of Annibale Carracci (1560-1609).",event53,,EOL
section116,user2,Guercino’s style motivated by commercial considerations,"Some speculate that this stylistic change was brought about by the popularity of classicism at the time, that Guercino strategically changed his style to suit the art market and gain more commissions.",event404,,EOL
section117,user2,Denis Mahon and Guercino’s preparatory sketches,"While Guercino is best known for his oil paintings, he was an outstanding and prolific draughtsman, producing hundreds of preparatory drawings and sketches for his paintings. These dynamic sketches, rapidly produced by Guercino, illustrate the artist’s process- many compositional changes are visible in these works. In November 1934, Denis Mahon purchased his first drawing by Guercino, 'Study of Putti for Aurora' (1621), from the art dealer, R.E.A. Wilson; the drawing cost £10.",event86|event405|event406|event89|event408|event96|event409|event407|event410,,EOL
section118,user2,A story from the second book of Samuel in the Old Testament was the source for ‘The Assassination of Amnon’.,"‘The Assassination of Amnon’ is a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, and depicts a story from the second book of Samuel in the Old Testament. Amnon and Absalom were half brothers and the sons of King David. When Amnon raped their sister, Absalom sought revenge, ordering his men to kill Amnon while he was drunk.",event411,,EOL
section119,user2,The biblical subject ‘the Pharoah’s daughter and the infant Moses’ may have been the source of Guercino’s ‘Four Women with a Child’.,"It is unknown if ‘Four Women with a Child’ was a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, and indeed the subject is still a mystery. While cataloguing the Royal Collection of Guercino drawings in 1989, Denis Mahon tentatively suggested two biblical subjects as sources for the this work – the Pharaoh’s daughter and the infant Moses, or Sarah expelling Hagar and Ishmael.",event412,,EOL

section121,user2,Strong public reaction to 'Decoration' in 1923,"When Mainie Jellett first exhibited 'Decoration' in the St Stephen’s Green Gallery- run by the Society of Dublin Painters- in 1923, it provoked a strong emotional reaction from the Irish public; people hurled vitriolic comments and negativity at Mainie Jellett, and at modern art in general.",event500|event501,,EOL
section122,user2,The Irish public's conservative artistic tastes in 1923 ,"If you consider other artworks, produced by Irish artists in the same year, you get the sense that what Mainie Jellett was doing was entirely new and shocking.",event500|event501|event503|event504|event505|event506,,EOL
section123,user2,An Irish newspaper reporter's reaction to Mainie Jellett's work,"A bamboozled reviewer for the Irish Times, who visited the exhibition in the St Stephen's Green Gallery, wrote:<br>“Miss Maimie Jellett is showing two paintings and two drawings. I fear that I did not in the least understand her two paintings. They are in squares, cubes, odd shapes and clashing colours. They may, to the man who understands the most up-to-date modern art mean something; but to me they presented an insoluble puzzle.”",event500|event501|event502,,EOL
section124,user2,Cubism was not newly introduced to the world in 1923,"Cubism was not new in 1923. Picasso’s proto-cubist work 'Les Demoiselles D’Avignon' had been painted in 1907, and the first Cubist group show was held in Paris in 1911. But Ireland, cut off from mainland Europe, and caught up in a political struggle, was still extremely conservative and traditional so that Cubism was still a shock to the system 15 years or so after it had been invented.",event508|event521,,EOL
section125,user2,"Decoration, an abstract, non-narrative painting","It is a completely abstract, non-figurative painting – Jellett is not concerned with presenting us with a narrative, but in experimenting with form and colour.",event509|event510|event500|event529|event530,,EOL
section126,user2,Religious elements in Mainie Jellet's paintings,"Even though 'Decoration' is an abstract painting, it does strongly recall a religious icon painting. Mainie chose to paint this using tempera on wood panel-<br>the primary medium used in panel painting in medieval and early renaissance Europe until the 1500s.<br>In her later work in the 30s and 40s, Mainie’s paintings would become more overtly religious, with stylised and semi-abstracted representations of the crucifixion, pieta, and Madonna and child, but at this early stage in her career it was just hinted at through medium and shape.",event500|event514|event515,,EOL
section127,user2,Mainie Jellett was influenced to paint in a Cubist style by Albert Gleizes,"Mainie painted 'Decoration' in a Cubist style – layering geometric shapes on top of one another almost like a collage, flattening the pictorial space, and emphasising the two dimensionality of the painted surface. At this time in the early 1920s she was studying under the cubist artist Albert Gleizes in Paris along with her friend Evie Hone, another important Irish artist who went on to develop a successful career in stained glass.",event516|event517|event530|event520|event521|event522,,EOL
section128,user2,Albert Gleizes' association with Cubism,"Gleizes had exhibited at the first Cubist group show which took place in a separate room – Room 41 - at the Salon des Independents in Paris in 1911. Although Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque would go on to become the driving forces behind Cubism, neither of these artists exhibited at this first exhibition. Neither were they involved in publishing the first major text on Cubism either – instead Albert Gleizes and fellow-artist Jean Metzinger published this in 1912.",event520|event521|event522|event516,,EOL
section129,user2,Albert Gleizes' rules of painting,Gleizes was an intellectual and theoretical painter who approached the canvas with a strict methodology – “the laws of painting” as he called it.,event522|event509|event510|event1033|event1034,,EOL
section130,user2,Mainie Jellett's early training and styles,"Mainie Jellett did not always paint in a Cubist style. In fact, like many other modern artists, such as Cezanne and Picasso, her rejection of the traditional conventions of painting was preceded by thorough academic training. She received early watercolour training in her home from Elizabeth or Lolly Yeats, Jack B. and W.B. Yeats’ sister.",event1|event524|event525|event527|event528|event1009|event1015,,EOL
section131,user2,Mainie Jellett and Andre Lhote,"In 1921, Jellett travelled to Paris and studied under the Cubist artist, Andre Lhote. Here she began her experimentations with Cubism, while still retaining an identifiable subject, such as the human figure or still life objects. Her paintings from this time show her beginning to simplify and reduce forms to the bare essentials, however, she had not yet begun to flatten and fragment her forms – the women in these paintings are rounded and robustly feminine.",event530|event529,,EOL
section132,user2,Mainie Jellett: Pioneer of Modernism in Ireland,"Despite all of the negativity that was directed towards her, included George Russell describing her work as defective in the Irish Statesman in 1923, Jellett continued to fight her corner and champion modern art in Ireland.<br>She continuously wrote essays, delivered lectures, and taught students about the principles behind this new approach to painting. In 1943, at the end of her short life, she was one of the founding members of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, a group of artists that rebelled against the conservatism of the RHA and promoted young Irish artists.",event1002|event1003|event1004|event1005|event1006|event1007|event1008|event511|event513|event1062|event1027,,EOL
