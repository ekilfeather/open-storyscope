Guercino's Roman period (1621–3), short in span though it was, exerted a lasting impact on his subsequent development. His early naturalistic chiaroscuro style, so successfully practised in Emilia, was not highly regarded in the sophisticated Roman court milieu in which he then found himself. His subsequent attempts to modify his style, acknowledging the more fashionable classical language of form made popular by the work of such painters as Guido Reni, heralded a fundamental change in his work. Henceforth there was a lightening of his palette and a tendency to make the spatial setting of his figures more lucid.",sourceevent320,Travel,1621,1623,Rome,Guercino,,,,,,,807e48c4-c6e4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,,EOL
