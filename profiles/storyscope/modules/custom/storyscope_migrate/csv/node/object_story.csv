Tempera is a mixture of pigment and egg yolk which was the primary medium used in panel painting in medieval and early renaissance Europe until the 1500s. It was a very suitable medium for those stylised and flat medieval panel paintings, as when it dries it produces a smooth, matte, opaque finish. <br >However, tempera paintings rarely have the deep colour saturation of oil paintings and so the colours in 'Decoration' do not pop or attract attention; they are quite muted, faded, and matte looking.<br >In the 30s and 40s, Mainie’s paintings would become more overtly religious, with stylised and semi-abstracted representations of the crucifixion, pieta, and Madonna and child.

Although Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque would go on to become the driving forces behind Cubism, neither of these artists exhibited at this first exhibition. Neither were they involved in publishing the first major text on Cubism either – instead Albert Gleizes and fellow-artist, Jean Metzinger, published this in 1912. <br >Gleizes was an intellectual and theoretical painter who approached the canvas with a strict methodology – “the laws of painting” as he called it. In an essay dedicated to Mainie Jellett, he describes his attempts, to explain his approach to non-representational painting, to his two new Irish pupils:<br >“Mainie and Evie used to come to the studio early in the afternoon. I used to place large sheets of paper on a stretcher and, charcoal in hand, I struggled to clarify and to make them understand the practical elaboration of my first modest paintings without subject.”<br >“Before me I had two young students who were wanting me to show them the substantial, rational, explainable method of building up a picture without having recourse to representation. I had, therefore, to analyse step by step the course of my own act of painting, to follow myself and at the same time to record my movements theoretically.”<br >One of Gleizes primary concerns was the rejection of traditional linear perspective, and the illusionism that had pervaded painting since the Renaissance. In an essay, he spoke about his rejection of linear perspective:<br >“The unity of perspective, which classical art considered a step forward and an advance on what went before, was denounced and replaced by plurality of points of perspective. This plurality of points of perspective in many paintings of the 14th century had been severely criticised as a sign of ignorance, as childishness. Unity of perspective had become a dogma.”<br ><br >",object303,,event516|event517|event520|event521|event522|event523,0,5395d0f6-c6e5-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

He went to school at Upper Canada College, and then received some training in painting by an art teacher named Thomas Drury at the Upper Canada College around 1830. In July 1834, he displayed some of his paintings in the first (and only) exhibition of The Society of Artists and Amateurs in Toronto, gaining a favourable review by a local newspaper, The Patriot.<br ><br >Kane began a career as a sign and furniture painter at York, moving to Cobourg, Ontario, in 1834. At Cobourg, he took up a job in the furniture factory of Freeman Schermerhorn Clench, but also painted several portraits of the local personalities, including the sheriff and his employer's wife. In 1836 Kane moved to Detroit, Michigan, where the American artist James Bowman was living. The two had met earlier at York. Bowman had persuaded Kane that studying art in Europe was a necessity for an aspiring painter, and they had planned to travel to Europe together. But Kane had to postpone the trip, as he was short of money to pay for the passage to Europe and Bowman had married shortly before and was not inclined to leave his family. For the next five years, Kane toured the American Midwest, working as an itinerant portrait painter, travelling to New Orleans.<br ><br >In June 1841, Kane left America, sailing from New Orleans aboard a ship bound for Marseilles in France, arriving there about three months later. Unable to afford formal art studies at an art school or with an established master, he toured Europe for the next two years, visiting art museums wherever he could and studying and copying the works of old masters. Until autumn 1842 he stayed in Italy, before trekking across the Great St. Bernard Pass, moving to Paris and from there on to London. In London he met George Catlin, an American painter who had painted Native Americans on the prairies and who now was on a promotion tour for his book, Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs and Conditions of the North American Indians. Catlin lectured at Egyptian Hall at Piccadilly, where he also exhibited some of his paintings. In his book Catlin argued that the culture of the Native Americans was disappearing and should be recorded before passing into oblivion. Kane found the argument compelling and decided to similarly document the Canadian Aboriginal peoples.<br ><br >Kane returned in early 1843 to Mobile, Alabama, where he set up a studio and worked as a portrait painter until he had paid back the money borrowed for his voyage to Europe. He returned to Toronto late 1844 or early 1845 and immediately began preparing for a trip to the west<br >Travels in the Northwest<br ><br >Ojibwa camp at the shores of Georgian Bay; a typical field sketch of Kane's from his first trip 1845<br ><br >Kane set out on his own on June 17, 1845, travelling along the northern shores of the Great Lakes, visiting first the Saugeen reservation. After weeks of sketching, he reached Sault Ste. Marie between Lake Superior and Lake Huron in summer 1845. He had intended to travel further west, but John Ballenden, an experienced officer of the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at Sault Ste. Marie, told him of the many difficulties and perils of travelling alone through the western territories and advised Kane to attempt such a feat only with the support of the company. After the Hudson's Bay Company had taken over its competitor, the North West Company of Montreal, in 1821, the whole territory west of the Great Lakes until the Pacific Ocean and the Oregon Country was Hudson's Bay land, a largely uncharted wilderness with about a hundred isolated outposts of the company along the major fur trade routes. Kane returned to Toronto for the winter, elaborating his field sketches to oil canvases, and in spring of the next year, he went to the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company at Lachine (today part of Montreal) and asked company governor George Simpson for support for his travel plans. Simpson was impressed by Kane's artistic ability, but at the same time worried that Kane might not have the stamina needed to travel with the fur brigades of the company. He granted Kane passage on company canoes only as far as Lake Winnipeg, with the promise of full passage if the artist did well until then. At the same time, he commissioned Kane to do paintings of Indian lifestyle for him, with some very detailed instructions as to the subjects.<br >Going west<br ><br >Canoe brigade preparing camp on the Winnipeg River while being visited by some Saulteaux. Field sketch by Kane, June 10, 1846.<br ><br >On May 9, 1846, Kane departed by steamboat from Toronto with the intent to join a canoe brigade from Lachine at Sault Ste. Marie. After an overnight stop, he missed the boat, which had left in the morning earlier than advertised, and he had to race after it by canoe. Arriving at the Sault, he learned that the canoe brigade had already left, so he sailed aboard a freight schooner to Fort William on Thunder Bay. He finally caught up with the canoes about 35 miles (56 km) beyond Fort William on the Kaministiquia River on May 24.<br ><br >By June 4 Kane reached Fort Frances, where a pass from Simpson for travelling further was awaiting him. His next stop was the Red River Colony (near modern-day Winnipeg). There, he embarked on a three-week excursion by horse, joining a large Métis hunting band that went buffalo hunting in Sioux lands in Dakota Territory in the United States. On June 26 Kane witnessed and participated in one of the last great buffalo hunts, which within a few decades, aided by railroad travel, decimated the animals to near-extinction. Upon his return he continued by canoe and sailing boats by way of Norway House, Grand Rapids, and The Pas up the Saskatchewan River to Fort Carlton. For variety, he continued from there on horseback to Fort Edmonton, witnessing a Cree buffalo pound hunt along the way.<br ><br >Jasper's House as painted in a field sketch by Kane in 1846.<br ><br >On October 6, 1846, Kane left Edmonton for Fort Assiniboine, where he again embarked with a canoe brigade up the Athabasca River to Jasper's House, arriving on November 3. Here he joined a large horse troop bound west, but the party soon had to send the horses back to Jasper's House and continue on snowshoes, taking only the essentials with them, because Athabasca Pass was already too deeply snowed in that late in the year. They crossed the pass on November 12 and three days later joined a canoe brigade that had been waiting to take them down the Columbia River.<br >In the Oregon country<br ><br >The interior of a ceremonial lodge in the Columbia River region painted by Paul Kane in 1846<br ><br >Finally, Kane arrived on December 8, 1846, at Fort Vancouver, the main trading post and headquarter of the Hudson's Bay Company in the Oregon Territory. He stayed there over winter, sketching among and studying the Chinookan and other tribes in the vicinity and making several excursions, including a longer one of three weeks through the Willamette Valley. He enjoyed the social life at Fort Vancouver, which at that time was being visited by the British ship Modeste, and became friends with Peter Skene Ogden.<br ><br >On March 25, 1847, Kane set out by canoe to Fort Victoria, which had been founded shortly before to become the new company headquarter, as the operations at Fort Vancouver were to be wound down and relocated following the conclusion of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which fixed the continental border between Canada and the United States west of the Rocky Mountains at the 49th parallel north. Kane went up the Cowlitz River and stayed for a week among the tribes living there in the vicinity of Mount Saint Helens before continuing on horseback to Nisqually (today Tacoma) and then by canoe again to Fort Victoria.<br ><br >Mount St. Helens erupting at night by Kane after his 1847 visit to the area<br ><br >His painting of Mount St. Helens in eruption at night in 1847 which is housed in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto was the only known image of an active Cascade volcano until the eruption of Lassen Peak in California in 1914. Although the scene was somewhat fictionalized, it did correctly show the active vent on the side of the volcano rather that the summit. He stayed for two months in that area, traveling and sketching among the Native Americans on Vancouver Island and around the Juan de Fuca Strait and the Strait of Georgia. He returned to Fort Vancouver in mid-June, from where he departed to return back east on July 1, 1847.<br >Crossing the Rockies again<br ><br >By mid-July Kane had reached Fort Walla Walla where he made a minor detour to visit the Whitman Mission that a few months later would be the site of the Whitman massacre. He went with Marcus Whitman to visit the Cayuse living in the area and happened to draw a portrait of Tomahas (Kane gives the name as ""To-ma-kus""), the man who would later be named as Whitman's murderer. According to Kane's travel report, the relations between the Cayuse and the settlers at the mission were already strained by the time of his visit in July.<br ><br >Kane crossed the Rocky Mountains twice in winter. (Field sketch by Kane, 1846.)<br ><br >Kane continued with one guide by horseback through the Grande Coulée to Fort Colville, where he stayed for six weeks, sketching and painting the natives who had set up a fishing camp below Kettle Falls at this time of the salmon run. On September 22, 1847, Kane assumed command of a canoe brigade up the Columbia River and arrived on October 10 at Boat Encampment. The party had to wait for three weeks until a badly delayed horse trek from Jasper arrived. Then they switched, the horse team taking over the canoes and going down the Columbia River, and Kane's group loading their cargo on the horses and taking them back over Athabasca Pass. They managed to bring all 56 horses safely and without loss to Jasper's House, despite the heavy snow and intense cold. As the canoes that should have been awaiting them had already left, they were forced to set out on snowshoes and with a dog sled to Fort Assiniboine, where they arrived after much hardship and without food two weeks later. After a few days' rest, they continued to Fort Edmonton, where they spent the winter.<br ><br >Kane passed the time at the fort with buffalo hunting, and also sketched among the Cree living in the vicinity. In January he undertook an excursion to Fort Pitt, some 200 miles (320 km) down the Saskatchewan River, and then returned to Edmonton. In April he visited Rocky Mountain House, where he wanted to meet the Blackfoot. When they did not turn up, he returned to Edmonton.<br >Going back east<br ><br >The fifth Fort Edmonton was constructed on the high ground above the North Saskatchewan River after the fourth fort, which had been located on the river banks, had been flooded several times.<br ><br >On May 25, 1848, Kane left Fort Edmonton, travelling with a large party of 23 boats and 130 people bound for York Factory, led by John Edward Harriott. On June 1 they met with a large war party of some 1,500 warriors of Blackfoot and other tribes who were planning a raid against the Cree and Assiniboine. On that occasion Kane met the Blackfoot chief Big Snake (Omoxesisixany). The canoe brigade stayed as briefly as possible and then continued hastily down the river. On June 18 they arrived at Norway House, where Kane stayed for a month, waiting for the annual meeting of the chief factors of the Hudson's Bay Company and the arrival of the party with which he was bound to travel further. On July 24 he departed with the party of one Major McKenzie; they travelled along the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg to Fort Alexander. From there on Kane followed the same route he had taken two years earlier going west: by the Lake of the Woods, Fort Frances, and Rainy Lake, he travelled by canoe to Fort William and then along the northern shore of Lake Superior until he reached Sault Ste. Marie on October 1, 1848. From there he returned by steamboat to Toronto, where he landed on October 13. He noted in his book on this last leg of his journey: ""the greatest hardship that I had to endure now was the difficulty in trying to sleep in a civilized bed"".",,,,0,5a1c83fc-c6e5-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

The central elements hint at seated and reclining figures, without being as specific as in her religious-inspired abstracts of the period. The 1920s were the decade when Jellett pursued her most abstract agenda, as the minimal titles, often ‘Composition’ or a number of ‘Elements’, make clear. This is an excellent example of Jellett’s engagement with modernism and the theories of Albert Gleizes (1881-1953) she had absorbed while making visits to his studio with Evie Hone (1894-1955). Having exhibited two abstract works in Dublin in 1923 (one of them Decoration, NGI 1326) that attracted great negative criticism, she was not deterred and developed her own distinctive abstract style. In the mid-1920s she exhibited with avant-garde painters in Paris, London and Versailles and was part of the Irish art section at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam in 1928. There is a sense of exploration that marks out her work, which adopts the approach and even some of the shapes familiar from Gleizes, achieved by the famous theories of ‘translation’ and ‘rotation’. She develops them with even greater rigour. She would frequently explore a theme in a series of graphite drawings. Three of these (NGI 18244-18246) show part of the development for this painting. A watercolour study, as was often made to establish the colours, is known (Peppercanister Gallery, Dublin, 2009). She pared away in places and added detailing in others to refine this non-representational language. The texture of the paint surface and canvas contribute to the tactile quality of the work, as in other pictures of the period. It has a refined notation and unusual green colouring that is very striking, hence being familiarly known as Green Abstract.<br ><br >(National Gallery of Ireland: Taking Stock Exhibition Catalogue. 2010)<br ><br >",object522,,event1054|event1055,0,145f93a4-c712-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

But when Jellett began to work as an abstract artist, an advocate of cubism, she relied less on watercolour and, instead, favoured the opaque medium of gouache. The density of this medium reinforced the cubist emphasis on the two-dimensional surface of a painting. A water-lily pond is an attractive image which exploits the decorative pattern-making of the water plants' leaves and flowers and probably dates from her first contact with cubism in London c. 1919. The fluidity and movement is all on the surface. There is no explicit attempt to create depth. Jellett obeys her own dictum: 'The surface is my starting point, my aim is to make it live' (MacCarvill 1958, p. 50).<br ><br >",object523,,event1056|event524,0,14a05128-c712-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

Also contributing to its new look was the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), which required reconstructing the parts of the city that had been destroyed. Impressionists such as Pissarro and Gustave Caillebotte enthusiastically painted the renovated city, employing their new style to depict its wide boulevards, public gardens, and grand buildings. The Gare Saint-Lazare was the largest and busiest train station in Paris. Early in 1877, with help from his friend Gustave Caillebotte, Claude Monet rented an apartment in the nearby rue Moncey and began the first of 12 canvases showing this icon of modernity. He displayed seven of them, including this one, at the third Impressionist exhibition, in April of that year. Legend has it that he arranged to have the standing locomotives stoked with extra coal so that he could observe and paint the effects of belching steam—dull gray when trapped inside the station, white and cloudlike when seen against the sky.",object609,,event2003|event2004|event2013,0,5f5dbe8a-c6e5-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

His homes and gardens became gathering places for friends, including Manet and Renoir, who often painted alongside their host. Following in the path of the Barbizon painters, who had set up their easels in the Fontainebleau Forest earlier in the century, Monet adopted and extended their commitment to close observation and naturalistic representation. Whereas the Barbizon artists painted only preliminary sketches en plein air, Monet often worked directly on large-scale canvases out of doors, then reworked and completed them in his studio. His quest to capture nature more accurately also prompted him to reject European conventions governing composition, color, and perspective. Influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, Monet's asymmetrical arrangements of forms emphasized their two-dimensional surfaces by eliminating linear perspective and abandoning three-dimensional modeling. He brought a vibrant brightness to his works by using unmediated colors, adding a range of tones to his shadows, and preparing canvases with light-colored primers instead of the dark grounds used in traditional landscape paintings.In the 1910s and '20s, Monet focused almost exclusively on the picturesque water-lily pond that he created on his property at Giverny.

Painters and sculptors were rigorously trained in the Neoclassical tradition to emulate artists of the Renaissance and classical antiquity. In the hierarchy of historical subjects recognized by the Academy, pure landscape painting was not a privilege. At best, artists could hope to paint an idealized nature inspired by ancient poetry, as seen in the work of seventeenth-century painters Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. Following in the path of Poussin and Claude, those eager to paint from nature went to Italy to paint and draw directly in the landscape. In 1816, the French Academy introduced a Prix de Rome in historical landscape painting. The prize, awarded every four years, enabled its laureate to live and work at the Villa Medici in Rome. Intended to restore history painting to its seventeenth-century glory, the new Prix de Rome actually prompted a frenzy of excitement over landscape painting. The exhibition of John Constable's pictures at the Paris Salon of 1824 further set the stage for this new genre in France. In warm weather, artists now ventured outside Paris to work from nature, traveling to the royal parks of Saint-Cloud and Versailles and to more far-flung areas of the country. No destination was more popular than theForest of Fontainebleau and a small hamlet therein - Barbizon. Despite differing in age, technique, training, and lifestyle, the artists of the Barbizon School collectively embraced their native landscape, particularly the rich terrain of the Forest of Fontainebleau. They shared a recognition of landscape as an independent subject, a determination to exhibit such paintings at the conservative Salon, and a mutually reinforcing pleasure in nature",object608,event2005|event2006|event2007,,0,1770f628-c712-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

The development of naturalism -- that is, the unidealized depictions of nature, usually scenes of rural life and countryside -- at the start of the nineteenth century was due in large measure to a reaction against the strictures of academic art and the excesses of romanticism. Commercially available paint sold in tubes was mass-produced by the 1830s, enabling artists to work outdoors with relative ease, and production of drawn and painted sketches outdoors became a component of artistic training.

He was influenced by Pop Art and his work developed towards photo-realism in the late 1970s. A large body of his work comprises portraits of well known twentieth century figures. A versatile artist, his work also encompasses graphic design, stage design and illustration. During the late 1960s, the Northern Ireland troubles politicised a number of Irish artists, such as Robert Ballagh, who responded directly in a range of works. Ballagh created several works which reinterpreted the material of classical artists whose work depicted scenes of political upheaval and violence, such as Francisco Goya and Jacques- Louis David. These works reflect Ballagh’s own concerns about social and political issues.<br >This painting is an interpretation of Liberty Leading the People (1830), a painting by the French Romantic painter, Eugene Delacroix. The subject matter of Delacroix’s painting is the turmoil and violence that continued on the streets of Paris following the French Revolution in 1789. In France, Liberty is depicted as a lady, her image is influenced by the statues of Ancient Greece, explaining her partial nudity and alluding to the ideals of democracy that began in Ancient Greece and Rome. Liberty charges forward holding the French flag to represent democracy. To the right of Liberty is a figure representing the working class and to the left a figure representing the middle class. At her feet we see fallen men, victims of the battle. The figure on the left in a nightshirt refers to the cruelty of the King’s soldiers who often killed men in their beds. The figure on the right is one of the King’s soldiers. Behind Liberty a mob of men surge forward and in the background the city is shrouded in smoke.<br >Ballagh uses a range of media in his work including paint, printmaking, collage and montage. He also works as a graphic artist and has designed stamps for An Post as well as set design and illustration. In this work, Ballagh recreates the composition of Delacroix’s painting but, in keeping with the graphic style of Pop Art, he simplified the elements of colour, tone and texture, reducing the image to a bold outline using flat, opaque areas of colours. The use of subtle grey, blue and navy in the figures and background provides a tonal quality to the work.<br >A version of this work has also been recreated using the technique of silkscreen printing which facilitates the creation of smooth, flat areas of paint.His use of solid outlines, flat colouring and the appropriation of contemporary imagery to document our time is characteristic of the Pop Art movement, and this style is evidenced in other work of the period by Valerio Adami, Richard Hamilton, Patrick Caulfield and Tim Mara.<br ><br >",object61,,event23|event24|,0,0d5e51d8-dde4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

He is concerned with depicting aspects of nature and weather manifest in the landscape.<br >Here Henry uses oil on canvas. In the early stages of his career charcoal was his preferred medium and he continued to use charcoal throughout his career in his preparatory sketches, many of which were done outdoors. He constructs his image through form and colour rather than line. He employs a subdued, monochromatic palette which he uses to convey the mood and atmosphere in the painting, rather than attempting to depict the reality of the actual scene.<br >Born in Belfast in 1876, Paul Henry studied at the Belfast School of Art and at the Academie Julian in Paris. He also worked in the studio of James McNeill Whistler. While in France he was influenced by the plein-air style of painting where artists worked outdoors focusing on nature and the landscape. He was influenced by Realist artists, such as Jean Francois Millet (1814-1875), who painted scenes of ordinary people working in the countryside and also by Post-Impressionist artists, such as Paul Cezanne (1839-1906), Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) and Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), in particular their emphasis on expression and their vibrant use of colour.<br >He moved to London where he worked as a newspaper illustrator and in 1903 he married the artist Grace Henry. They returned to Ireland in 1910 and moved to Achill Island, off the coast of Mayo. Henry was inspired on Achill to paint landscapes and scenes of local people working on the land, cutting turf, harvesting seaweed and launching boats. He left Achill in 1919, and his work from that point on focused on pure landscapes. In the 1920s and ‘30s several of his paintings featured in posters advertising Ireland as a tourist destination in Great Britain, Europe and the United States. This increased the exposure and popularity of his work and also contributed to a stagnation in the development of his practice. These images became associated with romantic and nationalist associations of west of Ireland as an idealised ‘authentic’ Ireland.<br >Few of Henry’s paintings are dated.<br ><br ><br ><br >",,,,0,0e7830d4-dde4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

Jellett believed there was a spiritual link between shape and colour and she has translated this into religious imagery. The subject matter of this painting by Mainie Jellett is religious, depicting the Virgin Mary and her child, Jesus. Through her vibrant use of colour and harmonious composition Jellett has created a mood of joy and elation. Light is emanating and radiating from the figures in the centre with slightly darker tones visible in the bottom part of the painting.<br >The style shows the influence of the Cubist artists, in particular Albert Gleizes with whom Jellett studied in Paris. Gleizes was a key figure associated with a form of Cubism known as Orphism, which is characterised by the use of bright colours and radiating forms as opposed to the monochromatic palette of Cubism associated with Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.<br >The composition of the painting depicts two abstract but distinguishable figures in the centre, the Virgin Mary on the right, and Jesus on the left. The painting is abstract, comprising flat surfaces and lacks volume and perspective. The form of the figures has been reduced to flat, geometric shapes. Rhythm and movement have been created in the composition through varying the size of the curved bands encircling the figures as well as the precise use of harmonious colour tones and hues. There is a white arc above each of the figures, probably meant to represent their halos. The painting is framed by borders of colour and in the area between the figures and borders paint has been applied in a Pointillist style.<br >Jellett believed there was a spiritual link between shape and colour and she has translated this into religious imagery.

objectstory511,user6,Cecil King's work from the 1970s onwards,"Cecil King (1921-1986) was an abstract-minimalist painter. His mature works have a distinctive cool minimalist formality and often involves clean blocks of even colour cleaved at an acute angle. An example of this is Sounion, which he painted in 1975. From the early 1970s onwards King found new and varied forms to explore through different geometric abstractions. Cecil King then began concentrating on the hard-edge paintings for which he is best-known. The play between flat surface and illusionist third dimension was a continuing preoccupation – the internal dynamics of colour and shape generating tension within his work. Following a visit to Berlin in 1970, King began his Berlin series – large-scale colour field works in which a narrow peripheral band creates a tension between figure and ground, in which some commentators have seen references to the Berlin Wall and a city divided. The same wall-like constructions continued in the later Haarlem paintings, begun after a visit to New York. Much of the power of King’s works comes from their meticulous execution. In an interview with Ciaran Carty in The Sunday Independent in 1982, he said: “There is no margin for error. The image has got to be there from the beginning. Colours can change as you go along, lines can be added. But you’ve got to have the basis right. With my type of painting, if you spoil it at any stage you miss out on the whole thing.” In 1967 the first ROSC exhibition was held in Dublin. The idea was to hold a major exhibition every four years which would expose an Irish audience to the latest trends in world art. King designed the first exhibition as well as the second ROSC in 1971. A retrospective of his work was held at the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery in 1981, another was held in the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) in 2008.<br ><br >",,,,0,0f301212-dde4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

As conceptual art emerged through the late 1960s, it became a major turning-point in 20th-century art. Its credo that art is ideas challenged notions about art, society, politics and the media.

objectstory513,user6,Le Brocquy's early work,"This is an early work by Louis Le Brocquy, in a realistic style prevalent in Europe and the USA during the 1930s. The painting depicts three figures having a picnic on the beach. All three figures are reclining at different angles. Le Brocquy uses the angles of their bodies to create a dynamic movement and to lead the eye through the painting. The woman in the foreground holding the cup looks out from the picture plane but her gaze is directed beyond the viewer. The angle of her body leads the eye to the man in the middle who looks down at the empty, white picnic blanket. Behind him is a woman smoking, who is also gazing at the picnic blanket. There is an open umbrella in the sand at her legs – its ambiguous presence suggestive of either sun or rain. Despite the title, there are only a few, carefully placed objects – cups, saucers and an apple – to indicate a shared picnic. The figures to not interact with or even look at each other; they stare pensively into the distance. The melancholy demeanour of the figures contrasts with the festive event implied in the title. The figures are bathed in light and it seems to be a sunny day in contrast with the mood of the painting which is pensive, as each figure is engrossed in their own thoughts. The composition of the painting reinforces the solitary nature of each figure.The composition and treatment of the figures suggest the influence of Impressionist artists such as Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas, also evident in the muted palette and use of black. The flattening of the picture plane is reminiscent to the work of the Nabis artists and ultimately Japanese Uyioke prints. The colours are neutral in a reduced palette, with rhythm created through the use of black and grey against a light background. This early work shows le Brocquy’s interest in capturing a person’s inner thoughts, revealing a sense of their personality and psychology, beyond exact physical representation in portraits.Born in Dublin, Louis le Brocquy studied chemistry at Trinity College Dublin. Following a period of travel in Europe studying artworks in the museums of France, Spain and Venice, he returned to Ireland to pursue his artistic career. He was a founding member of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1943, along with Evie Hone and Mainie Jellett, which aimed to promote the work of emerging and avant- garde Irish and international artists in Ireland. A self-taught Irish artist, le Brocquy is most famous for his paintings, including portraits of Irish literary and cultural figures, such as William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce and Seamus Heaney, but his broad practice also encompasses tapestry, printmaking, book illustration and set design. His work explores aspects of the human condition, in particular the experience of the individual in the modern era. In his portraits he attempts to capture the essence of human experience rather than an exact representation.<br >Le Brocquy experimented with a wide range of materials and techniques in his practice, including oil paint, ink and textiles. This early work displays a high level of skill and technical ability in draftsmanship, handling of paint and composition. His later work is characterised by loose brushwork and more fluid compositions verging on abstraction. In this early work, the artist uses pigment mixed with wax medium - a non-yellowing wax and resin mixture - which protects the paint surface from shrinkage, cracking, dirt, air and moisture. Portraiture and the exploration of the figure are constant features through the course of le Brocquy’s diverse practice.<br ><br >",,,,0,0f8c7336-dde4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

objectstory523,user6,Yeats's Liffey Swim,"Youngest of an unusually artistic family (his brother was the poet W.B. Yeats), Jack B. Yeats credited his childhood in the countryside of Sligo, with its atmosphere, light and landscape, for his becoming a painter. Initially, Yeats established himself as an illustrator for journals and other publications. In 1907, he painted his first landscape in oils, which from then onwards remained his main medium. The early works in oils are characterised by subdued colours with strong tonal contrast. <br >Considered to be one of the most important Irish painters of the early 20th century, Jack B. Yeats was born in London in 1871, and spent much of his childhood in county Sligo. He studied in several art schools including the Westminster School of Art in London and initially worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for London magazines and journals. He visited New York in 1904 and was exposed to the work of key modern artists. The influence of the vernacular realism of the Ashcan School in New York is evident in Yeats’ choice of subject matter – aspects of everyday life – and also his dark palette and expressive brushwork. Several works by Yeats were included in the seminal Armory International Exhibition of Modern Art in 1913. In 1910 he moved to Ireland and painted scenes of everyday life, in particular events and spectacles, such as horse races, the circus, markets or street scenes. <br >His later work is characterised by a gradual loosening of style, less dependency on line and use of a broader colour range and thick impasto paint. His later work is concerned with the expression of emotions of joy or grief through vivid brushstrokes and unmixed primary colours in dreamlike images.<br >",object302,,,0,130c67dc-dde4-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

He was released from Mountjoy jail in November. Larkin, the main protagonist on the side of the workers in the 1913 Lock Out, had a history within the trade union movement. His first experience with trade unionism in Ireland had been in 1907 when he was sent to Belfast as local leader of the British-based National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) after working as a docker in Liverpool. While in Belfast, Larkin organized a strike of dock and transport workers. It was also in Belfast that Larkin developed his tactic of the sympathetic strike, whereby workers who were not directly involved in an industrial dispute with employers would go on strike in support of other workers who were. The Belfast strike was moderately successful and boosted Larkin's standing amongst Irish workers. However, his tactics were highly controversial and as a result Larkin was transferred to Dublin. Unskilled workers in Dublin were very much at the mercy of their employers. Employers who suspected workers of trying to organize could ""blacklist"" them, practically destroying any chance of future employment. Nevertheless, Larkin set about trying to organize the unskilled workers of Dublin. This was a cause of concern for the NUDL, who were reluctant to engage in a full-scale industrial dispute with Dublin employers. As a result Larkin was suspended from the NUDL in 1908. Larkin then decided to leave the NUDL and set up his own union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU). The Catholic Church supported employers during the dispute, condemning Larkin as a socialist revolutionary. William Martin Murphy's media outlets, including the Irish Independent, portrayed Larkin as the villain of the dispute.",object377,,event541|event542|event545|event546|event549|event554,0,28d27a60-ea47-11e2-8753-002590937d1c,EOL

Many parents worked hard to create clean environments for their children. Poverty and hardship were realities in Dublin's tenements. Poverty had been perpetuated in Dublin by the lack of occupational opportunities for unskilled workers. Prior to the advent of trade unionism in Ireland, unskilled workers lacked any form of representation. Furthermore, there were many more unskilled labourers in Dublin than there were jobs for them. Thus unskilled workers often had to compete with one another for work on a daily basis, the job generally going to whoever agreed to work for the lowest wages. But this socio-economic hardship is not the only lens through which to view life in Dublin's tenements (the accounts of which are still in living memory).

Growing up in poverty, he received little formal education and began working in a variety of jobs while still a child. From 1893, Larkin developed an interest in socialism and became a member of the Independent Labour Party. He became a full-time trade union organiser in 1905. As a member of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) Larkin successfully organised workers in Preston and Glasgow, Scotland in 1906. Larkin moved to Belfast in 1907 and after expulsion from the NUDL, he founded the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  the Irish Labour Party, and later the Workers' Union of Ireland.
