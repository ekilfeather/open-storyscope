 * Field Styling
 *
 * The Fences module allows site builders to pick the semeantic HTML5 element
 * for each field while editing the field's settings. There's no way a theme
 * can ever know which element to use for the fields on your site, so Zen
 * just uses lets Drupal core or Fences decide. Since you DO NOT want 3 wrapping
 * divs around every field (do you?), we highly recommend Fences.
